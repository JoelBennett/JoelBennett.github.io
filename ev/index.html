    <h1>Welcome to the EV calculator!</h1>
    <p>The purpose of this site is to determine the point in time at which switching over to an EV (electric vehicle) makes economic sense.</p>
    <p>This will only give an approximate date, and it make make sense to switch to an EV sooner (or later) for other reasons.</p>

      <p>No calculator will be perfect.  This calculator makes a number of assumptions:
        <ul>
          <li>
            EV maintenance costs are significantly lower than internal combustion engines, but still not entirely $0.
            For example, brake pad replacements on the Nissan Leaf are much less frequent because of regenerative braking,
            which doesn't use the brake pads.
          </li>
          <li>
            Some businesses and employers offer free charging.  This may also reduce energy costs to the EV owner.
          </li>
        </ul>
